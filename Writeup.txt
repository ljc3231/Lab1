Writeup
As discussed above, your writeup should include all relevant decisions made in the implementation of your code.
 That is, how you implemented your cost function, how you implemented your heuristic, and justification for their correctness.

 In my code, I first decided the speeds through the different terrain types by grouping them by "unpassable", "slow", "normal"
 or "fast", and then gave them speed values corresponding to the terrain types. I also decided that from each pixel, we should 
 check the neighboring 4 pixels, instead of 8, as it would be similarly shaped paths, just slightly more optimized.

 For my cost function, i decided to use straight line 3D distance between the current point, and the current at the moment target.
 Upon reaching the first target, I would then go point by point updating the target until the end is achieved. This heuristic
 is good for this as it is both always shorter/closer than the true distance between the two points, and it represents the 
 theoretical optimal path from point to point (straight line).

 During my coding, I had a lot of problems getting both the normal map, and elevations to work simulataneously. Often I would get
 the normal map working, getting a correct path, but then when i tried to bring it to elevation/ I realized that my algorithm
 did not work well when reaching the edges of a map, and upon fixing that, the original map had broken (but /elevation was working).
